## Introduction
Hi👋 I'm [Sidney](https://github.com/sidney-eliot), a 3D character artist, and
this knowledge pool is for me, you, and everyone else.


> [!info]- More about this handbook
> I'm a self-taught artist, and I know just how difficult it can be to piece
> together a variety of snippets from various sources in an effort to get a
> complete picture. So, I made this handbook to cover the entire workflow, as
> well as other things, like composition, character design theory, anatomy, and
> more. I'm not saying that this is the end-all-be-all, but it can definitely
> be your main support line, which you can compliment with a bit of your own
> research.
>
> My goal with this handbook isn't to cover entry level stuff. Rather, the
> methods and workflows I explore are mainly industry standard; following them
> will yield great results. A perfect example of this would be the [[baking|
> baking]] page, in which I demonstrate how even amazing studios, like Riot
> Games, don't always have the best approaches to difficult problems.

This is probably best suited for intermediate and advanced 3D artists with the
focus being on game art. If you're a 2D artist, then you might find something
interesting [[#All Things from This Handbook Relevant for 2D Artists|here]]. My
3D workflow mostly consists of the following software:
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/features/), [ZBrush](https://pixologic.com/),
[Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya),
[Plasticity](https://www.plasticity.xyz/), [Marmoset
Toolbag](https://marmoset.co/toolbag/), [Substance
Painter](https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d-painter.html),
[Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) and [Unreal
Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/features). Therefore, this handbook
will cover workflows in the aforementioned software, but many of the concepts
are universal and can be applied to other software, as well.

If you don't understand a term, give the [[glossary|glossary]] a visit.

_Some parts of this handbook are still a work in progress, and those parts are
denoted with the 🚧 symbol. I also still have a lot planned for this handbook
and have many pages hidden in a work in progress section._
